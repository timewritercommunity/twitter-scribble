# twitter-scribble
The first experiment in timewriting. Development of a collaborative story on twitter. 

While we are building the time writer platform, let's experiment with “timewriting” on twitter and discord. 

What are we talking about?

We want to write a collaborative story with you! 

Every story has a starting point. For this story that starting point will be today. DAY 0! This plants the seed from which the story will evolve. Tomorrow and every day thereafter, we'll add two more story snippets, one extending the story into the future (DAY +1, DAY +2, ...) and one going back into the past (DAY -1, DAY -2, ...). 

Every day we go further into the future, the goal is to write a compelling continuation of the current day’s events.

Every day we go further into the past, the goal is to figure out what would have had to have happened for the days ahead to come true. 

We will post two new tweets per day to continue the story into both directions of time. Each tweet will quote the previous tweet in the timeline, so anyone who finds this story in the future, can read the entirety of it.

Let’s have some fun and collaborate. Submit your suggestion on how the story should evolve (either into the past, the future, or both) in the discord submission channel or reply on twitter to the day you want to extend (or preface). We will let the community decide who wins based on Tweet likes & Discord reactions.
